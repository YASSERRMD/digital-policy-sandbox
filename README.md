# Digital Policy Sandbox

This repository contains a research implementation generated using Chat.z.ai Agent Mode powered by GLM-5.

## Research Context

This project was generated to evaluate GLM-5’s ability to design policy simulation systems with scenario branching and impact modeling.

The benchmark focuses on:

- Versioned policy management
- Scenario branching logic
- Rule-based impact engines
- KPI modeling
- Multi-scenario comparison dashboards

## Project Overview

Digital Policy Sandbox simulates the impact of policy parameter changes before activation.

Key capabilities:

- Policy versioning
- Scenario cloning
- Impact simulation (revenue, compliance, workload)
- Multi-scenario KPI comparison
- Branch isolation
- Role-based access control
- Audit logging

## Technology Stack

- Next.js 16 (App Router)
- Node.js API Routes
- Prisma with SQLite
- In-memory caching
- Socket.io
- Docker

## Research Objective

This project evaluates GLM-5’s ability to:

- Generate branching system architectures
- Model simulation state isolation
- Implement rule-driven KPI calculations
- Maintain cross-layer consistency
